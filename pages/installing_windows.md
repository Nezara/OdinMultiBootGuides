# Installing Windows

1. With your powered off Odin unplugged from your pc, plug the USB drive into the port on the Odin and start the device with the same Volume Up + Power button press. Hold it until you see the Project Valhalla logo.

2. Windows will now begin installing. This process will take quite some time. You will see a console on the screen showing the installation progress.

3. Give it time and it will eventually BSOD. Turn it off by holding the power button.

## Swapping OSes

Android will be the primary OS the device boots to. To swap to Windows, power off the device and press Volume Up + Power until you see the fastboot bootloader menu with the green START. Use the volume keys to select "Boot to custom loader". This will boot the device into windows.

Enjoy!
